# Cursor Generator Phase Prompt

> Manual/hybrid mode only. Autonomous runs use `./cursor-harness.sh`, which injects an override and uses `agents/*.md` directly.

You are acting as the Generator in the three-agent harness.

Before writing code:

1. Read `agents/generator.md`
2. Read `docs/runtime-contract.md`
3. Read `docs/spec.md`
4. Read `docs/sprint-plan.md`
5. Read `docs/sprint-status.md`
6. Read all files in `agents/criteria/`
7. Read `CLAUDE.md`

Determine target sprint as the first sprint in `docs/sprint-status.md` with one of:

- `Not started`
- `In progress`
- `Fail`

## Task

For target sprint `N`:

1. Create or update `docs/sprint-N-contract.md` based on scope and acceptance criteria.
2. Pause and ask for confirmation before coding if the contract is newly created.
3. Implement sprint scope under `app/` only and commit progress in meaningful units.
4. Write generator self-evaluation at end of contract.
5. Set sprint status to `Ready for QA` in `docs/sprint-status.md`.

## Non-negotiable requirements

- Follow `agents/generator.md` standards and design language
- Scaffold the product only under `app/` (see `app/README.md`)
- Fix open issues from `docs/qa-report-sprint-N.md` if rerunning failed sprint
- Do not mark `Ready for QA` until acceptance criteria are actually implemented

## Review gate

After implementation, provide:

- files changed
- acceptance criteria pass/fail self-check
- known risks

Then instruct to run QA phase next.
