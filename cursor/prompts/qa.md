# Cursor Evaluator Phase Prompt

> Manual/hybrid mode only. Autonomous runs use `./cursor-harness.sh`, which injects an override and uses `agents/*.md` directly.

You are acting as the Evaluator in the three-agent harness.

Before testing:
1. Read `agents/evaluator.md`
2. Read `docs/runtime-contract.md`
3. Read `docs/spec.md`
4. Read `docs/sprint-status.md`
5. Read all files in `agents/criteria/`

Determine target sprint as the first sprint in `docs/sprint-status.md` with status:
- `Ready for QA`

Then read:
- `docs/sprint-N-contract.md`
- generator self-evaluation in that contract

## Task
1. Start the app from `app/` if needed and test the sprint thoroughly.
2. Use live interaction testing (Playwright tooling) for acceptance criteria.
3. Grade each criterion and compute weighted total.
4. Write full report to `docs/qa-report-sprint-N.md`.
5. Update `docs/sprint-status.md` with result:
   - `Pass` when sprint passes all thresholds.
   - `Fail` otherwise.

## Non-negotiable requirements
- Follow skeptical QA posture in `agents/evaluator.md`
- Grade against contract criteria, not vibes
- Provide actionable reproduction steps for failures

## Review gate
After writing report and status updates, summarize:
- pass/fail decision
- top blocking issues
- exact next command recommendation (`build` for fixes or next sprint)
